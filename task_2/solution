To calculate a cybercurity threat score for the whole company, first of all we need do find threat scores of each department.
So we will generate random data based on variables like mean, variance and number of samples.
After calculating mean threat score of a department, we use its importance level. 
For example:  Engineering and Finance got mean threat score of 50 both but one has importance of 5 and the other pne has 2.
In calculating aggregated threat score, importance 5 will make more impact(250 vs 100)
Aggregated threat score will be calculated by summing mean score of each department and then dividing it by sum of importances.
