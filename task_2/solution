To calculate a cybercurity threat score for the whole company, first of all we need do find threat scores of each department.
So we will generate random data based on variables like mean, variance and number of samples.
After calculating mean threat score of a department, we use its importance level. 
For example:  Engineering and Finance got mean threat score of 50 both but one has importance of 5 and the other pne has 2.
In calculating aggregated threat score, importance 5 will make more impact(250 vs 100)
Aggregated threat score will be calculated by summing mean score of each department and then dividing it by sum of importances.

Case 1: 
Departments have almost equal(similar) average threat scores and equal importance, no outliers.
Basic scenario.

Case 2:
One department has high importance and high average threat score.
To test if it works correcly with highly important department.

Case 3:
One department with low number of employees and high average threat score.
To test so that it wont affect the average threat score too much since its a small department.

Case 4:
Departments have big variance(difference) in threat scores, number of users and importance.

Case 5:
All departments with 0 threat score.

Case 6:
One department with very high threat score but with low importance.
To test how it affects the result.

Case 7:
Big variance in number of users in each department, but threat scores and importance are +- same.

Case 8:
All departments have high threat score and importance.
